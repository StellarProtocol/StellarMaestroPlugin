// Bounded "re-centre until laid out" for a hidden, auto-height dialog window. Begin() right after SetVisible(true);
// it then centres the window on a target point for a short per-tick window and stops by itself. Copied from MultiTool;
// Maestro opens every child window (Library, Settings, Preview, Link) centred on the main window with it.
//
// Manual centre, NOT WindowAnchor.Center: the framework's anchor centres on the DECLARED DefaultRect height, and these
// are auto-height (Height 0) windows, so it would pin the top at the target's middle. Centre on the window's actual
// laid-out win.Rect instead, in CANVAS units (IFramework.CanvasWidth/Height — ScreenWidth is physical px and is off by
// the UI scaleFactor away from native res). WindowBuilder-Patterns.md §"Centering a plugin window correctly".
//
// Why a short per-tick window instead of one SetRect: right after SetVisible(true) the rect can be 0 / stale (not laid
// out yet), and the height can change a tick later (e.g. a title wrapping once a name resolves). So keep re-centring
// while the computed target rect moves (own size OR the target point), and stop once it has held for StableTicks (or
// the budget runs out). Bounded on purpose: SetRect auto-persists, so it must not run every tick for the dialog's
// lifetime (KB §"A Draggable window = Anchor + PersistIfSettled"), and after it stops the user's drag is left alone
// until the next Begin().
